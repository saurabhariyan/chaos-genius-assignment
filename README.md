## Project Structure 


## Production Ready 
Documenting things skipped in the assignement that i would do in a real production web app, 
some are kept for ease of demo and others for time constraint.

* Dockerize the app
* settings.debug = True
* settings has a public secret key. 
* Add test cases
* Remove DRF browseable APIs
* Add caching based on bussiness logic, how quickly the files are updated, etc.


## Limitations:
both the files are stored locally in the data folder. updates *might* require a server restart.
